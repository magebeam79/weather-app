# Weather App

This is a simple weather app that displays current weather conditions for a user-specified location.

## Prerequisites

To use this app, you'll need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and set it as an environment variable named `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`. Without this key, the app will not be able to retrieve weather data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/magebeam79/weather-app.git

2. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run the app, simply execute the `app.py` file:


You will be prompted to enter a location. Once you enter a valid location, the app will retrieve and display the current weather conditions for that location.
